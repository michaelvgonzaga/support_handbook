# Blockers

## Purpose
Help identify and resolve blockers that impede progress on issues or development.

### Steps
1. **Identify the Blocker**:
   - What is preventing resolution?
   - Is it a technical, resource, or communication issue?
2. **Determine Ownership**:
   - Who can unblock this issue?
3. **Resolve or Escalate**:
   - Provide necessary resources or escalate to appropriate teams.
