# Networking Fundamentals

## Purpose
Understand the foundational concepts of networking and how they enable web communication.

### Key Topics
1. **OSI vs. TCP/IP Models**:
   - OSI Model: 7 layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).
   - TCP/IP Model: 4 layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).

2. **IP Addressing**:
   - IPv4 and IPv6: Differences, structure, and examples.

3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - Example: `www.example.com` -> `93.184.216.34`.

4. **Routing**:
   - How data packets travel between devices on the internet.

5. **Ports and Protocols**:
   - Common ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), SSH (22).
   - Protocols: TCP (connection-oriented) vs. UDP (connectionless).
