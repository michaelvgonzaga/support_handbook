## Purpose
Understand security practices and mechanisms to protect web applications and users.

### Key Topics
1. **HTTP Security Headers**:
   - `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Enforce HTTPS.
   - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME-type sniffing.
   - `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: Control resources loaded by the browser.

2. **SSL/TLS**:
   - Encryption protocols for secure communication.
   - Differences between SSL and TLS.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Cookies, tokens, and sessions.
   - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

4. **Common Vulnerabilities**:
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - SQL Injection.
