# SSO Best Practices

## Purpose
Implement best practices to ensure a secure and efficient SSO experience.

### Recommendations
1. **Ensure Time Synchronization**:
   - Use NTP to sync clocks across IdP and SP.
2. **Regularly Update Certificates**:
   - Set alerts for certificate expiration.
3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Continuously analyze IdP and SP logs for anomalies.
4. **Use Strong Encryption**:
   - Ensure certificates and tokens use strong encryption algorithms.
5. **Test Configurations**:
   - Regularly validate SSO configurations in staging environments.
6. **Implement MFA**:
   - Enhance security by integrating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with SSO.
